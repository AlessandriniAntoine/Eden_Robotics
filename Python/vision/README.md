# Vision

During this project we used openCV librairy.

First, we display the output of a webcam.

Then we set up an object recognition coupled with an object tracking. Thanks to this, the camera recognizes the object, targets it and tracks it. Once the object is targeted, the tracking is done only on this object, regardless of the presence of similar objects in the field of view.
